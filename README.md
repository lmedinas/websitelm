# Personal Website

I have been using Jekyll in the last years and recently i decided to try a more modern framework called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and i was instantly sold due to easier and more intuitive setup.

So basically this site is deployed on [Netlify](https://lmedinas.netlify.app) and it's created using:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
