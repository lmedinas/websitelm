I'm an Engineer who loves to Tech and tries to build great systems. All my life i was some way or another always involved with Technology.
With a very early age my parents got an [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) and later watching [Back to the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future) changed my life and i knew what i wanted to do from then onwards.
My alma mater is the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt) where I got a Masters in Physics Engineering. I have 2 lovely kids and married.
