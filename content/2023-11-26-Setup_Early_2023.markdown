# Hardware

## Custom Desktop PC

My current Desktop PC was assembled by me in 2021 shortly after the release of the [Ryzen Zen 3](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested) Generation. Replacing my old Intel i6700k which was showing signs of age on recent games.
The Idea behind this computer is to be a Gaming PC and a general Workstation.

Components:

* AMD Ryzen 5800X
* MSI Trio OC NVidia RTX 4090 
* 32GB DDR4
* 1TB NVME
* 1TB SSD
* 1TB HD
* ASUS MB B550 Gaming Pro Wifi
* Gigabyte M27Q Monitor
* Samsung 27" C27H Quantum Dot 

The Ryzen is a great processor, it runs very efficiently in both idle and high load with lot's of cores. This PC runs Windows 11 for now. When I need a development environment i most of the times use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) on WSL2 or VirtualBox no need so far to use on Dual Boot.

## [Macbook Pro 2020 Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/)

This is our family computer, we use it for Facetime, Surfing on the Web, Writing, Music Production and of course Coding. It's a terrific device, great Battery life, typical MacOS Unix-like features and the processor is amazing. Plus being able to run iOS apps its for me a no Brainer. This is one of my most used devices and I love it.

## [iPad Air 2021 Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/)

Used mostly by the Kids to play some Minecraft or watch Videos. Its also used by me to read, write and go through Doom Scrolling on X or Mastodon. It's fast and very eficient. It replaced our iPad Air 2 as it went out of support last year, this was one of the best devices i owned. The iPad Air is just like it's predecessor, superb.

## [iPhone 8](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP767?viewlocale=en_US)

Got it some years ago for a good price, new. Does its job, works great no major performance issues and good camera. My only issue is the Battery life.

## [Apple Watch Series 5](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-unveils-apple-watch-series-5/)

I was never a person who used Watches. But when Apple released the Apple Watch i said, when it will become mature and got the first major hardware update, i will get one. I bought it a few days after its available and i used it everyday since.
I like to track my heartbeats, fitness, watch weather and random Timers. In addition the integration in Apple ecosystem is great as expected.

I love it!

## [Raspberry PIs](https://www.raspberrypi.com)

## [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/)

Some short [review](https://lmedinas.netlify.app/posts/2022-11-12-steam_deck_review_after_1mo/). It's a great device, current generation games like Doom Eternal and Elden Ring run great. It's truly the year of Linux Desktop!

## Misc Devices

### PS4

Got it around in 2012. Worked great for casual gaming but games but running 1080p on 30FPS (rarely 60fps) and PSN was just too expensive. Its still used for casual CO-OP gaming. Might migrate to Steam Deck for CO-OP.

### iMac 27" late 2012

Was my main Desktop back in 2013-2016 but it was somehow underpowered for its great 27" Display. Games were not running well and HD drive was too slow.
Today it's rarely used, HD its incredible slow to even boot Mac Os Catalina. It's about to be retired. Basically the Macbook Pro is the replacement of this iMac.

# Software

## OS

* **Windows 11**
* **MacOS**
* **iOS / iPad OS**
* **Linux** (Steam Deck, Virtual Machines, RPIs and WSL) 

## Apps

* **Browsers:** mostly [Brave](https://www.brave.com/) but on Apple devices [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) works better. I gave up [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) some time ago, i was mostly using in the last few years just for the cause.
* **Editors:** Currently [Neovim](https://neovim.io). For years i've used Sublime Text and long time [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, i love Emacs but i realized by the size of my [.emacsrc](https://github.com/lmedinas/emacsrc) something wasn't right.
* **Mail:** Most of the time, Webmail and in some rare cases Apple Mail.
* **Other Apps:** Mainly I waste my time on Signal, WhatsApp, Facetime, X/Twitter, Mastodon and Steam.
* **Recording Music:** I use both Neural DSP Fortin Cali and Neural DSP Archtype Petrucci. Both are terrific but the Fortin is the one i use most of the time. It's incredible how good amp sims sound nowadays, out of the box sounds as good if not better than my Tube amps. As DAW i use Reaper.
