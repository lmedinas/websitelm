# Hardware

## Custom Desktop PC

My current Desktop PC was created in 2021 shortly after the release of the [Ryzen Zen 3](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested) Generation. Replacing my old Intel i6700k which was showing signs of age on recent games.
The Idea behind this computer is to be a Gaming PC and a Workstation.

Components:

* AMD Ryzen 5800x
* Asus NVidia 2080S
* 32GB DDR4
* 1TB 
* 1TB SSD
* 1TB HD
* 512GB SSD
* ASUS MB B550 Gaming Pro Wifi
* Gigabyte M27Q Monitor
* Samsung 27" C27H Quantum Dot 

The Ryzen is a great processor, it runs very efficiently in both idle and high load with lot's of cores. This PC runs Windows 10 for now. When i need a development environment i most of the times use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) on WSL2.

# Software

## OS

* **Windows 10** - Seems to be still the most stable Windows, as Windows 11 still has performance issues with Games.
* **MacOS**
* **iOS / iPad OS**
* **Linux** (Steam Deck, Virtual Machine, RPIs and WSL) 

## Apps

* **Browsers:** mostly [Brave](https://www.brave.com/) but on Apple devices [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) works better. I gave up [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) some time ago, i was mostly using in the last few years just for the cause.
* **Editors:** [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io). For years i've used Sublime Text and long time [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, i love Emacs but i realized by the size of my [.emacsrc](https://github.com/lmedinas/emacsrc) something wasn't right.
* **Mail**: Mostly Webmail and in some rare cases Apple Mail.
* **Other Apps**: Mainly to waste my time on Signal, WhatsApp, Facetime, Twitter and Steam.
* **Recording Music**: I use both Neural DSP Fortin Cali and Neural DSP Archtype Petrucci. Both are terrific but the Fortin is the one i use most of the time. It's incredible how good amp sims sound nowadays, out of the box sounds as good if not better than my Tube amps. As DAW i use Reaper.
