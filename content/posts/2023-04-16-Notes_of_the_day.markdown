* Woke up, had breakfast, catch up with Mastodon.
* Installed Linux on my main Desktop. Somehow due to the dual partition setup with UEFI the bootloader got broken.
* Last lunch with my mom, she is returned back home today.
* Drove her to airport. Felt alright but the airport was too crowded and it was rather confusing to me to see so much people.
* Back home, repaired the bootloader on my Main Desktop PC, still not happy with the setup. I will revisit this problem later next week. Still not convinced if i really need a standalone Linux on my Main Desktop. I'm pretty much happy with Virtualbox and WSL2.

**Mood:** Good.

**Music/TVShows/Internet highlights:** None.
