In 2022 was for me the year where i kinda of refined my music tastes and deep dived into Blues Rock and a small incursion into Technical Death Metal while returning to my usual Metal / Hard Rock genre.

## Blues Rock

![Hendrix](/static/hendrix1.jpg)

* I listen to Jimi Hendrix a lot in the past, of course its a huge influence on my guitar playing and i really enjoy playing his songs on my [Strat](https://www.fender.com/de-DE/electric-guitars/stratocaster/vintera-60s-stratocaster-modified/0149993305.html). This year i deep dived into his "clean" songs such like *Little Wing*, *Castles made of Sang*, *Like a Rolling Stone (live at Monterey)* and *Voodoo Chile (Blues version)*. Any of these songs are absolutely masterpieces.

* Stevie Ray Vaugh another Blues legend which died too early but left imense brilliant songs and performances. This year i listen in particular to *Texas Floods*, *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*, *Cold Shot* and *Lenny*.

* ZZ Top album *La Futura* from 2012 is a great album, at the same level as early *Eliminator* and *Tres Hombres*. Highly recommended!

* [Philip Sayce](https://www.instagram.com/philipsayce/) is for me one of the best modern Blues Rock legends. His playing style is amazing and his songs remind of a modern rockier version of Hendrix, SRV and many other Blues Legends.

* Now going into traditional Blues, Muddy Waters is my all time favorite and the real King of Blues. This year i saw many times his performance with [the Rolling Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3qfTk730Cw).

* I also really enjoyed and watched [Davey Bones posts on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daveybonesguitar/) about his Vintage gear and his Top Performances. Keep Rocking dude!

* Robin Trowner *Bridges of Sight* its another Blues masterpiece. 

* Honorable mentions: Jonny Winter, Eric Clapton, JJ Cale and Eric Gales

## Technical Death Metal

I was never a big fan of Death Metal, i always felt the style a bit shallow, tasteless and lyrics without interest. Exception for me was always *Children of Bodom* which is one of my favorite Bands ever but it can hardly classified as traditional Death Metal but more like a *Pop Melodic Death Metal*.
This year i decided to give another try and focus on the more Technical/Progressive side of the genre and i quiet enjoyed the bands mentioned below.

* Necrophagist, this band and the music done the band members is extremely complex and has lots of influences from *Classical* and *Jazz*. The songs on the album *Epitaph* are like travels into lots of different music styles, with lots of complexity taking into an extreme while having the traditional Death Metal base sound.

* Obscura, a band which reminds me of Necrophagist, even some members used to play on this band. The songs and amazing, following influences from Classical music. I'm only not totally convinced on the vocals which are maybe to extreme for me.

* Death, the album *The Sound of Perserverance* is a masterpiece.

Honorable mentions: Bloodbath, Lorna Shore

## Genera Metal / Hard Rock

![Zakk Wylde](/static/zakkwylde.jpeg)

nothing new, i just enjoyed the little time i have to enjoy music to hear again some of my favorite bands and artists. Some highlights.

* Zakk Wylde / Black label Society, one of my all time favorite guitar player. I listen to a lot of *Pride and Joy* his band from the 90s where he wrote some great Southern rock style music. Solo album *Book of Shadows* and the last BLS albums *Doom Crew Inc* and *Grimmest Hits*

* Dream Theater *Awake*, my all time favorite DT album. I love those 7-String guitar riffs.

* Fear Factory. *Demanufacture* and *Obsolete* are amazing albums i think this band was quiet underrated during the Nu Metal Boom in the early 2000s.

Honorable mentions: Mastodon and Nevermore.
