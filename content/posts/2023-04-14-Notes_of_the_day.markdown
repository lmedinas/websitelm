* Woke up early, slept well but not long.
* Appointment to check my eyes and vision due to often eyes burning and small headaches. No issues observed, which means I don't need glasses. Burning eyes might be due to lack of humidity in the eyes which could be caused by multiple factors (i.e dry air).
* short break to to play [Hunt:Showdown](https://www.huntshowdown.com/game).
* Visit the Doctor to see how I feel.
* Lunch with family. Took some time to check Mastodon and Twitter. 
* A new book arrived: [Ghost in the Wires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires) from the one and only Kevin Mittnick. Might start to read it this weekend.
