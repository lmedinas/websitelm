I fought very hard to avoid COVID-19, so my family did, but inevitably hit us at the end of 2022. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 3 years ago, we carefully avoided crowded places to avoid higher transmission, we used masks religiosity and disinfected groceries and hands.

Of course through the time we got fully vaccinated, the restrictions started to relax more and more until we were basically one of very few people still using masks on supermarkets. 
Then sadly shortly after Christmas i started to feel slightly sick, promptly performed a test and went immediately positive.

# Symptoms

The first symptom was pain all over my body: arms, legs, hands and back. Then I started to feel my throat sour and cough and a few hours later in the evening fever around 37.8 degrees Celsius. At the same time i felt incredibly tired and weak, even on the way to my home studio through my home stairs I felt tired. 
These were basically the symptoms for 3 days, on the 4th day I stopped having fever and sour throat and kept the pain around the body. 

During the time with COVID, I took the usual Paracetamol against fever and ate lot's of Fruit and vegetables.

# Post COVID

Eight days after the first positive Test, I tested myself again and finally went negative while still keeping incredibly tired, coughs and less muscle pain. Those symptoms hit me for another week, then slowly all symptoms started to disappear and back then only cough remained a few weeks longer.

After COVID I was concerned regarding the effects of [LongCovid](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-long-haulers-long-term-effects-of-covid19) but fortunately so far I didn't have any effect and I hope it remains like this.

After having heard from some people that COVID *"is just a like a simple flu"* I can certainly say, it's definitely NOT! After all this experience and with the [increase of health risks caused by COVID re-infections](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/repeat-covid-infections-health-risks) I will continue to use Mask wherever I can and will do whatever I can to avoid COVID again.
